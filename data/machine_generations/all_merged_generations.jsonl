Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year \u00bb . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending \u00bb . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\" Tracey said. \"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \"Politics is completely beholden to events,\" he said. \"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\" E-mail to a friend .", "output": "- Amount almost double what was spent in the 2004 election cycle.\n- Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise.\n- Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending.\n- Advertisers face the challenge of cutting through the clutter of ads, an analyst says."}], "is_classification": false}

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "output": "Prompt Waywardness: The Curious Case of Discretized Interpretation of Continuous Prompts"}], "is_classification": false}

You may also find that it helps to keep an exercise diary.

Remember, exercise doesn't have to be boring, and you're more likely to stick with a fitness program if you're having fun.  \n- Make physical activity part of your daily routine. If it's hard to find time for exercise, don't fall back on excuses. Schedule workouts as you would any other important activity. \n-  Some people find it helpful to work out with a friend. Invite friends or co-workers to join you when you exercise or go on walks. Work out with your partner or other loved ones.\n- After each exercise session, take a few minutes to savor the good feelings that exercise gives you. This type of internal reward can help you make a long-term commitment to regular exercise. External rewards can help too. When you reach a longer-range goal, treat yourself to a new pair of walking shoes or new tunes to enjoy while you exercise.\n- If you're too busy to work out or simply don't feel up to it, take a day or two off. Go easy on yourself if you need a break. The important thing is to get back on track as soon as you can.\nThere are a variety of ways to stay motivated during a workout.

Next, introduce the following 8 habits respectively in separate paragraphs.\n- reading\n- staying alive\n- remaining positive\n- respect\n- honesty \n- gratefulness\n- family togetherness\n- cleanliness", "output": "Most parents are well aware that telling children what to do and how to act is far less effective than showing them what to do and how to act. Teaching children what is a good habit early in life works best when the habit or behavior is modeled by the parents themselves. Whether the child is 3 or 13, kids look to their parents for guidance, so consider these 8 great habits for kids to develop early in life.\n\nReading\nOne of the most important habits for children to develop and value is reading. Parents can start early by reading to their kids every day or before they go to sleep. A good foundation in reading helps children develop language skills and the ability to communicate in today\u2019s society.\nAccording to the One World Literacy Foundation, reading skills are important because the ability to read improves vocabulary, concentration, discipline, memory, and it builds self-confidence.\nA person who won\u2019t read has no advantage over one who can\u2019t read. -Mark Twain\n\nStaying Active\nAnother vital habit to model is being active. Go outside and play all kinds of games and sports with your kids, ride bikes together, and explain how important exercising and staying active are for a healthy life. Kids who are active are less likely to develop obesity or sleep issues.\nIn addition, avoid being a couch potato yourself. Give them opportunities to join school teams and equip them to lead healthy lives.\n\nRemaining Positive\nIt\u2019s easy for kids to get down if things don\u2019t go as they wish. Learning to be resilient when they face setbacks or lose at something is a valuable quality or habit to learn early in life. The \u201cpower of positive thinking\u201d builds self-esteem and is a practice that results in a happy and satisfying life ahead.\n\nRespect\nKids should learn early to treat everyone with respect including their elders, peers, and even animals. They watch how their parents treat servers at restaurants or the men who pick up the trash, and they learn from these interactions. Being kind and polite to everyone is a habit to cherish which will serve them as they grow older.\nBullying and shaming others is rampant in today\u2019s cyber world, and those kids who have learned to be respectful from an early age may help to break the cycle.\n\nHonesty\nAlways tell the truth. Own up to mistakes and accept the consequences. Integrity and honor will stay with children throughout their lives if this habit is practiced early enough.\nAlways do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest. -Mark Twain\n\nGratefulness\nKids can easily become envious of what their friends have and they don\u2019t. Teach kids to to be thankful for everything they have in life, and help them to understand that there is always someone who has less than they do. Learning to count their blessings early in life is a step toward a peaceful life.\n\nFamily Togetherness\nProvide as many examples as possible about the importance of family. Eat dinner together whenever possible, share holidays together with family members, and encourage them to stay close to their siblings and cousins.  \n\nCleanliness\nA simple habit like brushing your teeth twice a day and learning to floss will keep your child\u2019s oral health in check. Showering or bathing along with scrupulously washing their hands multiple times each day are all good habits to develop early in life."}], "is_classification": false}

A company donates 10% of its profits to charity.**\n\nAnswer: **Ethical**\n\nThis is a statement about a company's social responsibility, indicating that the company is donating a portion of its profits to charity, which is a positive and ethical practice.\n\n**2. Create a detailed budget for the given hypothetical trip.**\n\nTo create a detailed budget for a hypothetical trip, we would need more information about the trip, such as:\n\n* Destination\n* Duration\n* Mode of transportation\n* Accommodation\n* Food and drink expenses\n* Activities and attractions\n* Other expenses (souvenirs, tips, etc.)\n\nHowever, here is a general outline of a budget for a hypothetical trip:\n\n* Transportation: $X\n* Accommodation: $Y\n* Food and drink: $Z\n* Activities and attractions: $W\n* Other expenses: $V\n* Total: $X + Y + Z + W + V\n\n**3. Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 11 - 5**\n\nAnswer: 2x = 6\n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n2x / 2 = 6 / 2\nx = 3\n\n**4. Solving the math word problem with linear algebra equations.**\n\nTo solve a math word problem with linear algebra equations, we need to:\n\n1. Read and understand the problem\n2. Identify the variables and constants\n3. Write the equation(s) based on the problem\n4. Solve the equation(s) using linear algebra techniques (e.g. substitution, elimination, matrices)\n\nFor example, if the problem is:\n\n\"Tom has 5 apples and 3 bananas. If he gives 2 apples to his friend, how many apples and bananas does he have left?\"\n\nWe can write the equation:\n\n5 - 2 = x (number of apples left)\n3 = y (number of bananas)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use substitution or elimination methods.\n\n**5. Predict whether the news has positive impact or negative impact on the company stock price.**\n\nTo predict the impact of news on a company's stock price, we need to analyze the news and consider the following factors:\n\n* The relevance of the news to the company's business\n* The potential consequences of the news on the company's operations and finances\n", "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, "created_at": "2025-11-08 18:01:59.217146"}, "request_idx": 2}

Is working part-time a good idea for teenagers between 15 and 19 years old?\n\nWorking part-time can be a good idea for teenagers between 15 and 19 years old, depending on their individual circumstances. It can provide them with valuable work experience, skills, and a sense of responsibility. However, it's essential to consider the following factors:\n\n* Balancing schoolwork and work responsibilities\n* Ensuring adequate time for rest and relaxation\n* Avoiding exploitation or overwork\n* Choosing a job that aligns with their interests and skills\n* Setting clear boundaries and expectations with employers\n\nUltimately, whether working part-time is a good idea for a teenager depends on their unique situation and priorities.\n\n3. My flight is canceled - can I sue them for a refund? Give me a detailed answer according to the law.\n\nIn the United States, the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 provides that airlines are not liable for damages resulting from flight cancellations or delays, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. However, you may be entitled to a refund or compensation under the following circumstances:\n\n* If the airline canceled your flight without notice or with inadequate notice\n* If the airline failed to provide reasonable accommodations or assistance\n* If the airline's actions were willful or reckless\n* If you can demonstrate that the cancellation or delay was caused by the airline's fault\n\nTo sue the airline for a refund, you would need to file a complaint with the Department of Transportation (DOT) or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). You may also want to consult with an attorney specializing in aviation law to determine the best course of action.\n\n4.

Identify the key questions or themes to be addressed in the essay.\n\n**Step 2: Generate ideas**\nUse various brainstorming techniques, such as:\n\t* Mind mapping: Create a visual map of ideas and concepts related to the topic.\n\t* Free writing: Write down as many ideas as possible without stopping or editing.\n\t* Listing: Write down a list of ideas, concepts, and potential arguments.\n\t* Asking questions: Ask yourself and others questions related to the topic to generate more ideas.\n\n**Step 3: Organize ideas**\nOrganize the generated ideas into categories, themes, or subtopics. Use a mind map, outline, or list to visualize the relationships between ideas.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate and refine ideas**\nEvaluate the generated ideas for relevance, feasibility, and potential impact. Refine the ideas by selecting the most promising ones and eliminating or combining less relevant ideas.\n\n**Step 5: Develop a thesis statement**\nBased on the refined ideas, develop a clear and concise thesis statement that summarizes the main argument or point of the essay.\n\n**Step 6: Create an outline**\nCreate an outline that organizes the ideas and supporting evidence into a logical structure.\n\n4.

If your flight is canceled, you may be entitled to a refund or compensation under the following circumstances:\n\n*   If the airline canceled your flight due to a mechanical issue or other circumstances within their control, you may be eligible for a refund or compensation.\n*   If the airline canceled your flight due to circumstances beyond their control, such as bad weather or air traffic control issues, you may not be entitled to a refund or compensation.\n*   If you purchased travel insurance, you may be able to file a claim for reimbursement.\n\nTo determine whether you can sue your airline for a refund, you should:\n\n1.  Review your ticket contract to see if it includes a clause that outlines the airline's cancellation policies.\n2.  Contact the airline's customer service department to see if they will offer a refund or compensation.\n3.

They were very direct and to the point, which sometimes came across as abrasive to our team. I recognized that their behavior was not intentional, but rather a result of their strong personality and work ethic.\n\nI decided to approach the situation by scheduling a one-on-one meeting with the team member to discuss my concerns and observations.

I made sure to follow up regularly to ensure that the plan was working and to provide feedback and support as needed.
